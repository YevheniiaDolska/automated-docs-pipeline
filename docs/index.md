## Documentation Pipeline Demo

This is a prototype documentation site demonstrating an automated documentation pipeline with GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), faceted search via Algolia, and CI/CD quality gates.

## What this demo shows

This site is not a replacement for [official docs](<https://docs.product.io>). It demonstrates documentation infrastructure: how to organize, validate, and publish developer docs at scale using automation.

The pipeline includes automated style checking with Vale, frontmatter validation for consistent metadata, GEO linting that optimizes content for AI-powered search engines, faceted search through Algolia DocSearch, and CI/CD workflows that monitor the upstream repository for documentation gaps.
